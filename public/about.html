<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 23 years old, I'm currently working in the food industry, 
  looking to  change careers and follow my true passions.
</p>

<p>
  I've always had a passion for Information Technology, and like many 
  others, my interest started with video games. I first became curious 
  about technology when my PSP broke. It gave me the chance to tear it 
  down and understand how it worked. After that, I wanted to learn how 
  the world created these amazing devices. This curiosity followed me 
  into adulthood. I've built multiple computers for myself and others, 
  troubleshot various issues, and even bought broken game systems just to fix them myself.
</p>

<p>I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about IT, and for a while, I 
  thought I would work as a technician or network administrator, something in that field. 
  While IT is a fantastic hobby, my true passion lies in programming. 
  I can't quite explain it, but I can't imagine working in anything 
  other than coding. The ability to create anything I want is incredibly 
  fulfilling to me. On top of that, my dream is to become a game developer. :]
